# Solidity Developer Assessment Methodology

## Overview

This documentation contains activity description and guidelines to be used by an inteviewer
when assessing a candidate's capabilities in Solidity, EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), and
related topics. This methodology is not exhaustive and does *not* cover topics such as
frontend design, development frameworks etc.

## Assessment Items

### Technical Questions

These questions are designed to assess a candidate's knowledge in:

* Algorithm implementation
* Design patterns
* Ethereum standards (ERC20, EIP-1967)

Link to the [Questions](./technical_questions.md).

### Scenario Based Assessment

This is designed to present to the candidate a task, not necessarily to complete, but to encourage
discussion / problem solving so that the interview is able to make an assessment to their problem 
solving / reasoning skills.

The interviewer's notes for the scenario based assessment should be updated as candidates
provide their answers to measure over time the 'uniqueness' of a candidate's answer and provide
supplemental notes to future assessors.

Link to the [Scenario Based Assessment](./scenario_based_assessment.md).

### Smart Contract Review

An ERC20 token contract has been created that intentionally contains errors ranging in ease of
discovery, and severity. This contract is contained within the `contracts` directory in this
repository, with associated tests to check the candidate's success.

Link to the [Contract Review](./contract_review.md).

## Grading

When grading a candidate, it's important that all assessors first meet to discuss their grading
system to ensure that there are no differences between assessors. Failure to do this will result
in inconsistent assessment between candidates.

Having an interview invokves nervousness in most people and this should be taken into account when
assessing. It's critical that assessors do their best to remove all biases related to gender, age,
ethnicity, sexuality, or other properties that are not relevant to their performance as a Solidity
developer.
